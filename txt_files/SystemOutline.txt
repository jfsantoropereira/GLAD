# GLAD System Outline

## Overview
GLAD (General Language Assistant and Developer) is an AI virtual coworker powered by Claude, designed to assist users through a Telegram interface. The system provides a robust platform for executing various tasks including Python code execution, terminal commands, and web searches.

## Core Components

### 1. Main System (main.py)
- Entry point for the GLAD system
- Initializes core components (LLMContext, MemoryManager)
- Sets up logging configuration
- Launches the Telegram bot interface

### 2. AI Components

#### 2.1 Context Management (system/ai/context.py)
- Class: LLMContext
- Manages conversation context with Claude
- Handles system prompts and tool configurations
- Maintains conversation history within token limits
- Processes streaming responses from Claude
- Integrates with XML processor for tool execution

#### 2.2 XML Processing (system/ai/xml_processor.py)
- Class: XMLProcessor
- Processes XML tags in Claude's responses
- Manages tool execution and result injection
- Handles task tracking and lifecycle
- Supports tags: task, thinking, answer, python, terminal, perplexity
- Provides streaming buffer processing for real-time responses

#### 2.3 Memory Management (system/ai/memory.py)
- Class: MemoryManager
- Handles persistent storage of conversation history
- Implements file-based memory with thread-safe operations
- Supports tagging and filtering of memories
- Provides memory retrieval with time-based filtering

### 3. Platform Interface

#### 3.1 Telegram Bot (system/platforms/telegram.py)
- Class: TelegramBot
- Provides user interface through Telegram
- Handles commands: /start, /help, /status, /clear, /tasks
- Manages message processing and response handling
- Integrates with LLMContext for AI interactions
- Displays system status and tool availability

### 4. Tool Executors

#### 4.1 Base Executor (tools/executor/base.py)
- Class: BaseToolExecutor
- Provides base functionality for all tool executors
- Implements timeout handling and result formatting
- Defines common interface for tool execution

#### 4.2 Python Executor (tools/executor/python_runtime.py)
- Class: PythonExecutor
- Executes Python code with safety measures
- Implements sandboxed execution environment
- Handles package installation for missing dependencies
- Provides restricted builtin functions
- Includes timeout and resource management

#### 4.3 Terminal Executor (tools/executor/terminal.py)
- Class: TerminalExecutor
- Executes terminal commands safely
- Implements whitelist of allowed commands
- Provides security checks for command execution
- Handles process management and timeouts

#### 4.4 Perplexity Search (tools/web/perplexity.py)
- Class: PerplexityExecutor
- Performs web searches using Perplexity API
- Implements rate limiting and request caching
- Handles error recovery and retries
- Formats search results with sources

## Configuration

### 1. System Configuration (config/config.json)
- Model settings (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
- Tool configurations and timeouts
- Memory settings
- Logging preferences

### 2. Platform Configuration (config/platforms.json)
- Telegram-specific settings
- Command definitions
- Platform-specific behavior

## Security Features

### 1. Python Execution

## Memory and State Management

### 1. Conversation Context
- Maintains chat history within token limits
- Tracks message timestamps
- Manages task state and history

### 2. Persistent Storage
- File-based memory system
- Thread-safe operations
- Tagged memory entries
- Time-based filtering

## Task Management

- Unique task IDs
- Status tracking (running/completed)
- Execution time monitoring
- Task history maintenance

### 2. Tool Integration
- Seamless tool execution
- Result injection into responses
- Error handling and recovery
- Progress updates to users

## Error Handling

### 1. Tool Execution
- Timeout management
- Error recovery strategies
- User-friendly error messages
